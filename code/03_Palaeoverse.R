#   3. Functions within the package Palaeoverse
# 
# ******************************************************


# Palaeoverse (palaeoverse.palaeoverse.org) is an R package containing functions
# specifically for cleaning and exploring fossil occurrence data. It is designed
# to be used prior to any specific analyses you wish to undertake.

# Two vignettes are provided with the palaeoverse R package. These are:
#   - Latitudinal trends in Phanerozoic reefs (github.com/palaeoverse/palaeoverse/blob/main/vignettes/phanerozoic-reefs.Rmd)
#   - Alpha diversity and geographic range size of Carboniferous and Permian tetrapods (palaeoverse/palaeoverse/blob/main/vignettes/tetrapod-biodiversity.Rmd)

# Walking through these vignettes should give you an idea of the functionality
# available in the package and how this might be applied to a dataset.

# You can also see the Methods in Ecology and Evolution paper introducing the package here: doi.org/10.1111/2041-210X.14099)

# If you have any questions, please feel free to email Bethany, or any of the package development team!
