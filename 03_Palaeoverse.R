#Palaeoverse vignette

#[Palaeoverse](palaeoverse.palaeoverse.org) is an R package containing functions
#specifically for cleaning and exploring fossil occurrence data. It is designed
#to be used prior to any specific analyses you wish to undertake.

#Two vignettes are provided with the palaeoverse R package. These are:
#- [Latitudinal trends in Phanerozoic reefs](github.com/palaeoverse/palaeoverse/blob/main/vignettes/phanerozoic-reefs.Rmd)
#- [Alpha diversity and geographic range size of Carboniferous and Permian tetrapods](palaeoverse/palaeoverse/blob/main/vignettes/tetrapod-biodiversity.Rmd)

#Walking through these vignettes should give you an idea of the functionality
#available in the package and how this might be applied to a dataset.

#You can also see the *Methods in Ecology and Evolution* paper introducing the
# package [here](doi.org/10.1111/2041-210X.14099)

#If you have any questions, please feel free to email Bethany, or any of the
#package development team!
